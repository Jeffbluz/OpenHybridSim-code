Once these dependent libs are check out, the following steps are recommended:

1) Install a development IDE. Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ ) is recommended here.
2) Import both ipss.lib and ipss.3rdPty.lib project into the IDE
3) check out this project <OpenHybridSim-code> through the IDE. 
4) run the test suite to make sure all tests are passed, which means the development environment has been properly set up.

## Usage and development
Users are recommend to walk through the classes and  test cases to get a basi idea of how the calsses are organized.
